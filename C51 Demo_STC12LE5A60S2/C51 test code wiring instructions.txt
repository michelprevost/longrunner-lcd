4 touch screen touch wiring

/ / the module need to connect an external XPT2046 touch touch test sampling chip, so this procedure does not touch the test.

/ / or module itself without touch not touch, can not connect

5 supporting code description:

//C51 integrated test program _ILI9481 (simplified test - suitable for small single chip ROM capacity)

Test MCU: STC89C52

The code to perform only brush full red, blue and green cycle that is the most simple test procedure for judging whether the wiring is correct and hardware is intact, such as LCD screen can display the red, blue and green proved that this model is no problem.

//C51 comprehensive testing procedures _ILI9481 (integrated test - for more than ROM 30K microcontroller)

Test MCU: STC12LE5A60S2/STC12C5A60S2

This code contains the scraper, in both English and Chinese show that images showing the stipple line painting circle display function, and so on, the larger compiled hex file, it is recommended to use more than 30K ROM chip testing.
